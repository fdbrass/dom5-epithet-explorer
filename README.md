# Dom5 Epithet Explorer

A tool to explore pretender epithets/titles for the game Dominions 5. Deployed on **[epithets.illwiki.com](https://epithets.illwiki.com)**.

## Future improvements

Minor improvements:
- bug: "# of Poetry and Song" has order >= 65535
- handle titles (Prince / Lord / Emperor / etc)
- sprites for pretenders
- grey-out already picked epithets
- handle special chars somehow 
- add explanatory title/hover texts to all constraints
- add a random trivia in the footer, e.g. ruler of nothing, TC/yomi epithets, unreachable epithets, male:female stats, number possible eps, one-of-a-kind epithets, highest number of epithets possible
- layout: make switching between main page and constraint-pages user-friendly 
- constraint-page: for sorcery/wizardry/all paths
- constraint-page: for fear/awe/strength/domstr
- constraint-page: for disciples
- constraint-page: friendly intro text
- constraint-page: sort constraints s.t. relevant constraint comes first in each epithet



Major features that could be nice at some point:
- estimate dominion strength from number of epithets
- reverse-explorer: from a pretender design, estimate probability to get each epithet
