# Dom5 Epithet Explorer

Tool for the game Dominions 5 to explore pretender epithets/titles.

## To do

minimum before "release"
- handle titles (Prince / Lord / Emperor / etc)
- analytics: basic

small improvements
- alt-text for images
- sprites for pretenders
- combine constraints to show pretender's total constraints 
- warn of incompatible selected epithets
- grey-out already picked epithets
- grey-out epithets that will cause collision
- handle epithets with the same name
- handle special chars somehow 
- add explanatory title/hover texts to all constraints
- make usable on mobile
- "no restrictions" text if there's zero constraints
- animation: make less jerky when the widest epithet is removed
- analytics: picked epithet
- slightly transparent dropdown box


larger bonus features that could be nice some time
- show all epithets with specific constraint (on separate page for SEO-friendliness)
- estimate dominion strength from number of epithets
- save pretender(s) for game? cookie
