# Dom5 Epithet Explorer

A tool to explore pretender epithets/titles for the game Dominions 5. It is deployed on [epithets.illwiki.com](https://epithets.illwiki.com).

## To do


small improvements
- combine e.g. "EA Abysia or MA Abysia" to "EA/MA Abysia"
- handle titles (Prince / Lord / Emperor / etc)
- sprites for pretenders
- warn of incompatible selected epithets
- grey-out already picked epithets
- grey-out epithets that will cause collision
- handle special chars somehow 
- add explanatory title/hover texts to all constraints
- make usable on mobile
- animation: make less jerky when the widest epithet is removed
- handle js being cached
- handle S>=0 for "of the apes" so samename-collapsing can handle it


larger bonus features that could be nice some time
- combine constraints to show pretender's total constraints 
- show all epithets with specific constraint (on separate page for SEO-friendliness)
- estimate dominion strength from number of epithets
