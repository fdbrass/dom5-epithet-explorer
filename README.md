# Dom5 Epithet Explorer

A tool to explore pretender epithets/titles for the game Dominions 5. Deployed on **[epithets.illwiki.com](https://epithets.illwiki.com)**.

## Future improvements

Known bugs:
- "# of Poetry and Song" has order >= 65535

Minor improvements:
- list EA/MA/LA in order, e.g. for God of Luck Through Hard Work
- handle titles (Prince / Lord / Emperor / etc)
- sprites for pretenders
- grey-out already picked epithets
- handle #/##/$ chars somehow 
- add explanatory title/hover texts to all constraints
- add a random trivia in the footer, e.g. ruler of nothing, TC/yomi epithets, unreachable epithets, male:female stats, number possible eps, one-of-a-kind epithets, highest number of epithets possible
- constraint-page: for sorcery/wizardry/all paths
- constraint-page: for fear/awe/strength/domstr
- constraint-page: for disciples
- constraint-page: for nations
- constraint-page: for pretender chassis
- constraint-page: for constraint-less epithets
- constraint-page: "misc"/"special" for epithets not listed elsewhere, e.g. eyes and ruler of nothing
- constraint-page: friendly intro text
- constraint-page: sort constraints s.t. relevant constraint comes first in each epithet
- constraint-page: add e.g. "not demon" epithets after demon constraint-page
- google search console thinks page is not mobile friendly because "clickable elements too close together"

Major features that could be nice at some point:
- estimate dominion strength from number of epithets
- reverse-explorer: from a pretender design, estimate probability to get each epithet
