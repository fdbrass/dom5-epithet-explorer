# Dom5 Epithet Explorer

A tool to explore pretender epithets/titles for the game Dominions 5. Deployed on **[epithets.illwiki.com](https://epithets.illwiki.com)**.

## Future improvements

Minor improvements:
- handle titles (Prince / Lord / Emperor / etc)
- sprites for pretenders
- grey-out already picked epithets
- handle special chars somehow 
- add explanatory title/hover texts to all constraints
- mirror/rsync deploy script instead of copying
- add a random trivia in the footer, e.g. ruler of nothing, TC/yomi epithets, unreachable epithets, male:female stats, number possible eps, one-of-a-kind epithets, highest number of epithets possible


Major features that could be nice at some point:
- constraint-page: list all epithets with specific constraint
- estimate dominion strength from number of epithets
- reverse-explorer: from a pretender design, estimate probability to get each epithet
